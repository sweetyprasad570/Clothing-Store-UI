## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout, responsiveness, and visual effects (e.g., gradients, hover effects).
* **JavaScript:** For dynamic functionalities such as:
    * Implementing the "Add to Cart" logic.
    * Managing the cart item count using `localStorage` for persistence.
    * Controlling the background video playback.

## üõí Shopping Cart (Basic Implementation)

The `addToCart` function in the JavaScript saves items to the browser's `localStorage`. This means items added to the cart will persist even if the user closes and reopens the browser tab.

* `localStorage.getItem("cart")`: Retrieves the cart data.
* `localStorage.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart))`: Saves the updated cart data.
* `updateCartCount()`: Updates the number displayed next to the cart icon.
